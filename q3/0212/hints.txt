Part A:

Go through the scoreList
	if there is the same score
		increment the scoreInfo
		return false 

When the for loop is done, that means you haven't incremented any score.
Add a new scoreInfo to the scoreList.
Sort scoreList by score.
returnt trye

or

if scoreList is empty
	add a new score 
	return true
		
Go through the scoreList
	if there is the same score
		increment the scoreInfo
		return false
	if the score of i is greater than score
		add it to the location of i
		return true
If the for loop is done, then you reached the end  
Add a new scoreInfo to the scoreList. (this will add a score to the end)
return true

		
Part B:
Go through the array of stuScore
	call record(int) for each score
