Part A (Do Part B First)
Go through each item in downloadList using a loop
	Check if the title (e.g. call getTitle()) is eqaul to tile passed in
		if this is true, return that item

For your default case, return null 
	

Part B
Go through the list of titles passed in using a loop
	Create a boolean variable called found and set it to false
	Go through downloadList using a loop
		If the current item's title (e.g. call getTilte()) in downloadList is equal to the title in the list of titles
			Call incrementTimesDownloaded() from the current item in downloadList.
			Set found to true
			
		
	If found is still false (That means the title doesn't exist in downloadList)
		Add a new DownloadInfo object with the title's name to downloadList.
