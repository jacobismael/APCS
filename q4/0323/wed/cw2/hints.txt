Part A
Instantiate board with the size of palyerCount
Go through the board using a loop
	Assign each slot a random number between 1 and 10 inclusive.

Set currentPlayer to a random number between 0 and playerCount-1 inclusive.


Part B

Get the number of token in the board array given the currentPlayer index. (e.g. board[currentPlayer] ) 
and store it a variable called tokenToDistribute
Set board[currentPlayer] to 0.
Create a position variable and set it to the next player (currentPlayer+1)

In a while loop, set the condition while tokenToDistribute is greater than 0
	Check if the position variable is at the end. (board.length)
		Set it back to zero to start at the beginning of the board
	
	Increment the number by 1 at the board given the position variable
	Decrement the tokenToDistribute by 1
	Increment the position variable by 1
