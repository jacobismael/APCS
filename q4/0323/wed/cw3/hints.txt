Part A 
Create a newWord string to store the scramble word
Go through each letter of word, except for the last since you are checking two letters at a time
	Check if the current letter is an A and the next letter is not an A
		Reverse the letter and add to newWord, increase i by 2 to skip 2 letters
		(e.g. newWord += word.substring(i+1, i+2) + word.substring(i, i+1) )
	else 
		Add one letter to newWord
		(e.g. newWord += word.substring(i, i+1) )
Return newWord

Part B
Go through the wordList
	Call scrambleWord passing in the current word from wordList. Store the result
	if the result is equal to the orignal word 
		Remove it. (Make sure to use i-- after the removal)
	else
		Replace (set) that location with the scramble word
