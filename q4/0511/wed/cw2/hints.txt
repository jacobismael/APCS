Part A
Create a count variable and set it 1.
Create a while loop with the condition of n not equals to 1
	if n is even ( use mod ) e.g (n%2 == 0)
		set n to n divide 2
	else (odd)
		set n to n * 3 + 1
	
	increment count

return count



Part B
Call hailstoneLength passing in n
If the result is greater than n
	return true
else
	return false
	
	
Part C
Create a count variable and set it to zero
Using a for loop, go from 1 to n (inclusive) using i
	Call isLongSeq passing in i
	If the result is true
		increment count

return count divide n.  (don't forget to cast one of the variable to a double)
