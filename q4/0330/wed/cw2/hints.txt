//Part A
//Go through the entries instance variable
	//get each row (e.g entries.get(i).getValue() ) and check if matches the row passed in and 
	//get each col and check if it matches the col passed in
	//if they both match
		//get and return the value at that location 
		
		
//Part B
//Go through the entries list
	//if the col (getCol()) matches the col passed in
		//remove it from entries (don't forget to add i--)

//Go through the entries list
	//if the col is greater than the col passed in
		//set that location to a new SparseArrayEntry(*) passing in the same row, the col minus - 1, and the same value for the constructor
	
//substract the numCols variable by 1
