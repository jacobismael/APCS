# APCS
A collection of my work from my AP Computer Science class I took in freshmen year of high school.

This Repository is supposed to be private as it is against the rules to share code for any classes. The code is only here as a backup in case anything happens to the copy on my main hard disk.

Any project can be run by using the following command:
```bash
javac *.java && java Runner
```
