# AP Computer Science A
A collection of my work from my AP Computer Science class I took in freshmen year of high school (2019 - 2020).

This Repository is supposed to be private as it is against the rules to share code for any classes. The code is only here as a backup in case anything happens to the copy on my main hard disk.

# Running the projects

Any project can be run by using the following command:
```bash
javac *.java && java Runner
```

I used [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) while testing and running these labs

> There may be few labs missing because 1) I switched computers mid-year and 2) I initially joined the class later then most
